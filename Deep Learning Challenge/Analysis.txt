Results Neural Network Model:
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    *The target variable is "IS_SUCCESSFUL", which tells us if the application was funded or not.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    *"APPLICATION TYPE", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE CASE", "ASK AMT", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME AMT", "STATUS", "SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS"

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? 
    * The "EIN" and "NAME" were dropped

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    *Neurons- 128, 64, 32, 1 
    *Activation Functions- ReLU, Sigmoid
    *Oprimizer- Adam
    *Loss Function- Binary Crossentropy

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    *Our best model reached 73% acurracy. No it did not meet the target.
    
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    *increase hidden layers and neurons, impemented dropout layers, tuned functions and used Standardscaler.

Purpose:
**The purpose of this analysis is to build and optimize a neural network model that can predict if AlphabetSoupCharity application funding will be successful or not.
